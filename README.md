Our goal was to design a device that would help people in rural Mexican communities safely transport, lift, and rotate 5-gallon water jugs. While the prototype requirements only called for lifting a 1-gallon jug, my two teammates and I chose to design for the full 5-gallon scale, since our solution was both feasible and practical. Guided by customer research and cost constraints, we developed a compact crane with a manual winch that succeeded in raising and rotating the jug with minimal effort, allowing even less able users to easily mount their water. In full-scale production, the design could be manufactured at lower cost and higher quality, making it an accessible and user-centered solution.
